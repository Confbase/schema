OVERVIEW

If called with no arguments, 'schema infer' reads from stdin and writes the
inferred schema to stdout.

If called with arguments, each argument is interpreted as a file path. The 
schema for each path is inferred and written to a new file of the same path, 
but with its basename prefixed with the string 'schema.'. For example,

$ schema config1.json config2.json

will write the inferred schemas to schema.config1.json and schema.config2.json,
respectively.

COMMON MISTAKES

TOML does not support nil/null values. 'schema infer' will not create schemas
with null values. This has implications for the commonly-used idiom

$ cat sample_data.json | schema infer | schema init --toml

Since the input stream---'sample_data.json'---is JSON, it could contain null
values. In turn, a schema with null values could be inferred and piped to
'schema init --toml'. However, 'schema init --toml' will fail immediately
upon encountering null values, since TOML does not support them.

---

There is no well-defined mapping between XML and key-value stores. Despite this,
schema still provides some support for inferring the schema of XML. schema uses
the library github.com/clbanning/mxj. Users can expect the behavior of schema's
infer command to match the behavior of github.com/clbanning/mxj's
NewMapXmlReader function when parsing XML.`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		infer.InferEntry(inferCfg, args)
	},
}

func init() {
	inferCmd.Flags().BoolVarP(&inferCfg.DoPretty, "pretty", "p", true, "pretty-print the output")
	inferCmd.Flags().BoolVarP(&inferCfg.DoMakeRequired, "make-required", "r", false, "make all fields required")
	RootCmd.AddCommand(inferCmd)
}
