If the files are both JSON schemas, they are interpreted as such and type
differences between the schemas are output.

Otherwise, their schemas are inferred and the differences between the inferred
schemas are output.

There are two types of differences:

    1. A field is included in one schema but missing from the other
    2. A field is in both schemas, but the type in each schema is not the same`,
