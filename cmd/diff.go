	Short: "Output the structural differences between two files",
	Long: `Outputs the structural differences between two schemas or files.

If the files are both JSON schemas, they are interpreted as such and type
differences between the schemas are output.

Otherwise, their schemas are inferred and the differences between the inferred
schemas are output.

There are two types of differences:

    1. A field is included in one schema but missing from the other
    2. A field is in both schemas, but the type in each schema is not the same

EXIT STATUS

If there are no differences, the program exits with status code 0.

If there are differences, the program exits with status code 2.

If there are any fatal errors, the program exits with status 1 and output is
undefined.`,
